    <div>This is the Gemstone font! I found it on Google Fonts and downloaded
         it as a .ttf file. I placed this file in the same directory as this
         .html file. It is applied here via @font-face and, within it, the url()
         CSS function; the .ttf file is referenced within the url() function.
         div is then used to link the font to the text.</div>
  </body>
