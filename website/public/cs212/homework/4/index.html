      	 Throughout all recorded history, nature has imposed itself onto humanity as a source of fascination and terror. Early <i>Homo Sapiens</i>, aware of their meekness and vulnerability, did their best to rationalize nature, trying to find any way to appease its capriciousness. When civilization grew more advanced, including the invention of a writing system, nature was readily recorded and revered. In the biblical tradition, nature was conceived as the Garden of Eden, directly formed by God to nurture Adam and Eve. Later on, nature was exalted as one of the Hellenic seven wonders of the world, displaying its beauty as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Despite the drastic deviations in religion and philosophy throughout the ages, nature remained upheld as an undeniable presence. Humanity celebrated it when nature was merciful, creating agricultural and solar based holidays that later evolved into modern holidays such as Christmas and Easter. However, as society progressed into the industrial age, humanity stepped toward an existence without nature; humanity no longer felt the obligation or interest to consistently interact with nature beyond it serving as an economic commodity. In our modern era, this distancing has only further deteriorated.

      	 In numerous academic studies and personal anecdotes, this relationship between humanity and nature is considered detrimental to our mental health and overall well-being; therefore, by increasing the amount of exposure to natural environments, an individual’s mental health should improve, especially for those that have significant mental illnesses or disorders. This paper seeks to provide evidence in support of this claim: by discussing the history of nature-based mental interventions, the theories claiming our innate need for exposure, the methods required for effective treatment, and the accessibility of this treatment. Through mental health interventions based on exposure to natural environments, patients with mental illnesses will experience a reduction in their symptoms because of humanity’s innate need to be with nature.

        <p class="essay">
      	 The concept of nature as a mental health treatment is not a recent hypothesis. Its earliest evidence of discussion and implementation was in the Middle Ages. Citing from the authors of <i>Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations</i>, Gregory Bratman, a doctoral student Stanford University’s Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, quotes, “[…] Marcus and Barnes trace the incorporation of restorative gardens and natural areas in infirmaries back to the Middle Ages, referring to the nearly thousand-year old writings of St. Bernard that support the healing effects of these natural spaces” (118). Despite acclaim by the Catholic saint, his observations could be considered inaccurate or misguided by the modern medical community, due to the age it was written in. However, following the Enlightenment, nature-based treatment was still implemented by medical institutions and recommended by authorities on nature. Paul Camic, a professor of psychology and public health at Canterbury Christ Church University, states that “[g]ardening has long been considered therapeutic for people experiencing mental health difficulties, with horticultural activities featuring in the early psychiatric institutions in Europe and the USA in the 1800s” (214). By this era, nature-based mental treatments were active for hundreds of years. Because of this longevity, the previous claim by St. Bernard may be more readily accepted, as would the whole concept of nature-based interventions, by today’s medical community.

        <p class="essay">
      	 Interest in the correlation between mental health and nature was revitalized in the wake of society’s spatial shift towards indoor settings. Using a statistic from 2009, Camic notes that, “[…] it is estimated that people typically spend 95-99 per cent of their time indoors” (215). Furthermore, Daniel Cox, a researcher at the University of Exeter, additionally notes from a 2012 statistic that “[a]longside stress, they are some of the most prevalent work-related health issues” (1). From this data, along with the increased rates of mental illnesses, medical communities have recently reconsidered the benefit that patients may gain from nature-based programs. Thus, measurable data advocating for these programs are relatively new; for instance, all of the research papers cited in this paper are no older than a decade.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">
         Another variable of contention for researchers is population densities. Common belief dictates that those in higher populated areas are more susceptible to mental illnesses than those in lower populated areas. Joshua Breslau, a senior behavioral and social scientist, lead a research project concerning this topic. Concluding his statistical analysis, Breslau explains, “The findings […] challenge the accepted wisdom that major depression and other serious mental illnesses are more common
         in urban than in rural areas in the US. We found no differences in risk […]” (53). From this result, a clearer understanding of mental illness treatment through nature can be made. Furthermore, by having this evidence, mental health interventions can be implemented in more suburban or rural areas as well, since they have the same need as those in urban populations. Thus, treatment can be given to anyone, no matter their location’s population density.

         As methods were developed for treating mentally ill patients with interventions based in natural environments, two theories have been developed to explain the psychology between humanity and nature. The first theory is the biophilia hypothesis. In summation, it is explained that “[…] we, as human beings, have an innate love for the natural world, universally felt by all, and resulting at least in part from our genetic make-up and evolutionary history” (Bratman 119). By distancing from nature, and therefore reducing the exposure to that innate love, humanity is psychologically damaging itself. Furthermore, this hypothesis implies that humanity is suffering from the same mental and emotional consequences as other losses of positive relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">
         While the biophilia hypothesis addresses the feelings and relation status with nature, the attention restoration theory is more concerned with how nature affects human cognitive functioning. The theory “[…] suggests that people have two types of attention: directed attention (requiring effort, e.g. when we problem solve) and fascination (non-goal oriented and effortless attention). […] Fascination is thought to be dominant in natural environments […] where there are captivating stimuli to hold attention” (Camic 215). In the workplace, direct attention is constantly required, especially for positions that require a higher education. These positions are not only strenuous and demanding, but are also most frequently in a permanent indoor setting, such as a cubicle or an office. Without the consistent opportunity to see nature and therefore receive that fascination, there is nothing to counterbalance that direct attention. The stress and anxiety that accumulates from an over abundance of direct attention can be destructive to mental health.

        <p class="essay">
         There are many approaches to treating mental illnesses through nature-based interventions. The accessibility and affordability of natural environments, including neighborhood parks, community gardens, and household yards, allows for many possibilities in terms of the intervention itself. Jo Barton, a professor of biological science at the University of Essex, approaches this treatment by experimenting with the effectiveness of green exercise, defined as an activity or exercise in the presence of nature. She noted that the “[g]reatest changes come from 5 min of activity, and thus suggest these psychological measures are immediately increased by green exercise” (3949). While physical activity is already known as an effective method for reducing mental illnesses, Barton’s results imply that the presence of nature acts as a catalyst, increasing the effectiveness of the treatment overall. Therefore, by combining exercise and natural environments, the reduction rate of mental illness severity is more efficient in nature than in public gymnasiums or other indoor exercise locations.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">
         Other studies sought evidence for nature being an effective treatment on its own. Synthesizing data from multiple different studies in the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Korea, and Hong Kong, Paul Camic found that “[…] all studies reported beneficial effects of gardening-based interventions for people experiencing mental health difficulties” (218). Cultural perspectives amongst nationalities and regions do not seem to be a variable, since the participating countries in Europe and Asia had no difference in results, despite having massive differences in culture; this indicates that using nature as a mental health treatment can be universally applied, regardless of culture. In addition, Camic’s findings also indicate that those with previously established mental health difficulties gain the most benefit from these treatments. Alongside the slower, yet still effective benefits for those with less severe symptoms, nature as a standalone treatment is sufficient to properly treat and prevent mental health issues.

        <p class="essay">
      	 Even when nature is simulated through pictures and sounds, the reduction in symptom severity is notable. Tori Rodriguez, a psychotherapist located in Atlanta, published an article summarizing the positive results from other studies. Analyzing a study that researched the effect of picture slides and sound files on viewers, Rodriguez reported, “The researchers found that participants who had viewed [slides of] nature scenes had higher activity of the parasympathetic nervous system – the “rest and digest” branch of the autonomic nervous system, which helps balance the activity of the sympathetic, or “fight or flight”, branch- […] The [pre-recorded] sounds of nature appear to have similar benefits” (2). This then allows for more flexible interventions, as a slideshow of natural scenes would be more accessible than a daytrip to a national park or even a stop at the neighborhood park; this is especially helpful to those most vulnerable, since their work schedule and required time indoors can be uncompromising. Further research would need to be conducted to see if simulated exposure has the same benefits as real exposure. However, regardless of if the simulated version is less effective or not, it is still a beneficial method of treatment.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">
         Literature also reflects a strong support for the beneficial aspects of nature. By writing about their thoughts and observations, two prolific nature writers discuss how nature resonates with them and therefore improves their own mental health. In his book The Suburban Wild, nature writer Peter Friederici devotes a chapter to discuss the emotional dynamic between humanity and water; he recalls, “This was the full desolation of fall, I thought, when it seems as though all life has fled inward. The steel-gray lake, in its seclusion, was the perfect mirror of my own feelings” (100). By gazing out into the lake, Friederici gave himself the opportunity to think without the effort of a particular topic. This then allowed him to be introspective about his emotions and mental condition. Famous American essayist John Burroughs also commentates on the healing properties of nature. Within a published collection of nature writing essays, organized by Bill MacKibben, Burroughs exclaims the availability of nature’s health benefits in the introduction of his essay, <i>Nature Near Home</i>; he points to the seasonal cycle as an easy source of happiness, stating that “[t]he seasons bring to his door the great revolving cycle of wild life, floral and faunal, and he need miss no part of the show” (MacKibben 168). The availability and variety that comes with the seasons suggests that they could be an additional supplement of nature exposure for those with severe symptoms. This way, attention towards nature can be effortlessly maintained. From these perspectives, the concept of nature as a medical treatment is made more holistic.

        <p class="essay">
         Nature-based mental interventions are already in mainstream use and can be used as an example for developing more effective programs. Germany is one example of promoting nature as a medical treatment. The German healthcare system implements nature as “[…] <i>Kur</i> (“course of treatment” involving nature walks, herbal remedies, and mud baths) […]” (Bratman 119). Interestingly, <i>Kur</i> goes beyond the types of treatment discussed in this essay, including activities that allows patients to interact with nature in different manners. Further research would be needed to test the effectiveness of these alternative treatments; however, their inclusion in Kur indicates their capability as a legitimate treatment.
        </p>
        <p class="essay">
         By fulfilling the psychological need for natural environments and by offering mental health interventions based on this need, patients have a reduction in their symptoms, especially for those with more severe cases. The financial and locational accessibility of nature allows for treatment to be beyond the normal scope of standard therapeutic and psychological procedures; regardless of medically organized interventions or self-imposed activity, it is readily available. This is what makes nature-based treatment particularly special and is therefore deserving of further research and professional usage.

    <p class="essay">
    For this assignment, I particularly focused on utilizing CSS to 1. reduce unnecessary HTML code and 2. better format my essay to fit MLA standards. The first large change that I made was approaching the hanging indentation within Works Cited differently. As opposed to hard-coding via HTML's div, I instead created a CSS class just for MLA indentations. The other classes reflect each portion of the paper (body, titles, header) and what specific MLA rules are applicable to them (Times New Roman font, paragraph indentation, double-spaced lines, etc). Changing of colors was not necessary, considering this is an academic paper. I made no modifications to the general margins, as that was not necessary. As for the HTML Abuse: I was able to eliminate using center, div, h2,
