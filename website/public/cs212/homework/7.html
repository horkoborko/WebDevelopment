    <p>The problem I sought to solve was how to dynamically accept, calculate,
      and output the result.</p>
    <p>I knew that HTML forms had to be used, but before beginning the assignment,
      I had to research how JavaScript worked, since I never coded in it before.
      From what I discovered, I needed script tags and a function.</p>
    <p>Implementing the math functions and variables in JavaScript were easy enough,
      as was making the HTML form, but I struggled a lot with passing the data between
      HTML and JavaScript. I received help from Balaji, who pointed out that my ids
      were off. After modifying the code to better link the HTML form with the
      JavaScript function and vice versa, the output finally works. Additionally,
      I originally planned on using document.write(), but I found that it was
      not as dynamic as I wanted it to be. I ended up changing it to window.alert(),
      because this way, the holy grail grid is preserved and numbers can be inputed
      multiple times in a row with no need to move pages.</p>
